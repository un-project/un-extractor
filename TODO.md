# TODO

Open tasks and known limitations for the un-extractor pipeline.

---

## Extraction accuracy

---

## Metadata

---

## Pipeline robustness

- [ ] **Retry on LLM failure** — The LLM enrichment phase catches all exceptions and logs
  a warning, but does not retry. Add a simple exponential backoff (1–2 retries) for
  transient API errors.

---

## Database

- [ ] **Amendment table population** — `src/db/models.py` defines the `amendments` table
  but `import_json_to_db.py` does not populate it yet. ~40 % of amendment-related stage
  directions have no document symbol (oral amendments, context-dependent references), so
  extraction would silently miss most records. Additionally `resolution_id` is non-nullable,
  making it impossible to store oral/undocumented amendments. Defer until the schema is
  relaxed and the extractor handles contextual resolution references.

- [ ] **Concurrent import race condition** — Running two importer processes against the
  same database simultaneously can create duplicate rows (both read "symbol not present"
  before either writes). Use `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` or a PostgreSQL advisory
  lock keyed on the document symbol.

- [ ] **Speaker deduplication ignores language** — The deduplication key is `(name, country_id,
  organization)`. A delegate who speaks in both English and French is treated as the same
  speaker, which is correct; but two different delegates with the same name from the same
  country are silently merged. Consider adding a secondary check on first-seen meeting date
  or exposing duplicates as a data-quality report.

## Documentation

- [ ] **LLM enrichment walkthrough** — Add a section to README.md showing a concrete
  example of running with `--llm` and what fields it populates vs. rule-based extraction.
